# Nim Application Bundler

Nab's goal is to allow you to bundle any Nim project for various platforms with
a single command -- without cluttering your repo with a bunch of files.

## Credit

A lot of credit goes to yglukhov, who put a lot of work into getting nimx builds
working. The goal here is to take a lot of that effort, untether it, and add a
user experience that makes bundling Nim so easy that users don't have to worry
about setup.
